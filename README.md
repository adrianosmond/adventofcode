# Advent of code

Solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) problems. A new one gets released for each day in December until Christmas and they generally get progressively harder as the month goes on. If you haven't given it a go then you should - it's really fun.

This isn't really designed for you to download and run, but if you really want to you'll need to provide your own input files. You can get yours from [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Disclaimer

This is not my most elegant work. A new problem gets released at 6AM local time for me and I like to try to solve it before I go to work, so a working solution is (in this case) more important to me than an elegant one. Sometimes I come back and clean up the code, but not always.
